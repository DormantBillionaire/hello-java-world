# Hello World (Java Version)
Set of basic java scripts demonstrating that I still have a syntax brain..
## Experimentation 
Attempted to execute this and push it through Mac OS terminal, but the syntax proved to be a little difficult, I'll attempt this with the next project. 

# What Did I learn? What Am I Unsure On? 

 I'm under the impression that you can also choose what language your project will be in (initially), but im curious for when multiple programming languages get underway, how does that work? 



## Executable Future Projects (Summer 2025): 

**Calculator** - Basic with just the scanner for user input, and maybe some if statements. 
      
(Scalable Option) Then as time goes on maybe implement a user interface/ some design features. 

**Digital Planner / To-Do List** - Simple and basic, yet I feel like this will be good in terms of practice 

(Scalable Option) - Get the respective college or university involved, for instance, adding a canvas integration (Not sure how possible that is, or if thats somethign thats open-source)

**Timer** - Another simple one that i know in Java I can use System.CurrentTimeMilis function. Theres also some cool websites allowing you to count up or count down to times and dates in the future

(Scalable Option) - Allow the user to choose certain historic dates in history (Gettysburg Address, "I have a Dream Speach, etc) and return the time since the event, or the time until the 10th or 20th anniversary of said event

**Random Sentence Generator** - Executed one of these in the past using a fill in the blank kids joke card, and it would be cool to see how I can jazz it up 

(Scalable Option) - Add visualizers for the birthday card, and just fill in the blanks with the users answers. Possibly use canva for a design template and then program it somehow 


## **My Current philosophy is that the best teacher is practice and just doing more projects, and if I get stuck, then consult a tutorial. But, dont go down tutorial-hell voluntarily.**
