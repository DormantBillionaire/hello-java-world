# Hello World (Java Version)
Set of basic java scripts demonstrating that I still have a syntax brain..
## Experimentation 
Attempted to execute this and push it through Mac OS terminal, but the syntax proved to be a little difficult, I'll attempt this with the next project. 

## For Projects In The Future
1. I'm under the impression that you can also choose what language your project will be in (initially), but im curious for when multiple programming languages get underway, how does that work? 

'''
2. Also im interested in executing the following: 
      Calculator - Basic with just the code, then maybe scale up as time goes on and implement a user interface/ some design

      Digital Planner / To-Do List - Simple and basic, yet I feel like this will be good in terms of practice 

      Timer - Another simple one that i know in Java I can use System.CurrentTimeMilis function. Theres also some cool websites allowing you to count up or count down to times and dates in the future

## My Current philosophy is that the best teacher is practice and just doing more projects, and if I get stuck, then consult a tutorial. But, dont go down tutorial-hell voluntarily.
